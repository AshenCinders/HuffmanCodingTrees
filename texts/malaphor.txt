It takes a village to raise an idiot.
We'll die on that hill when we get there.When all you have is a stone, everything looks like 2 birds.
You either die a lemon, or you live long enough to see yourself become lemonade.
This was the needle that broke the haystack.
Take a chicken across the road and it will get to the other side; teach a chicken to cross the road and people will ask why for the rest of its life.
The road to hell wasn't built in a day.
Break a clock and it will be wrong twice a day, teach a clock to break and it'll be wrong for a lifetime.
Look both ways before you jump to conclusions.
Keep your doctor close, but your apples closer.
Those who don’t seize the day are destined to repeat it.
We are just beginning to scratch the tip of the iceberg.
In the land of nails the one with the hammer is king.
You miss 100% of the ships you pass in the night.
Does the pope shit in the woods? It's not over until the pigs fly.
Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.
Sticks out like a green thumb.
Caught between a rock and a hardboiled egg.
Some men just want to watch the cookie crumble.
You can hold your horses but you can’t make them drink.
Where there’s a will there’s a won't.
How the tables have turned over a new leaf.
Teach a man to swim and he’ll live to swim another day.
There's plenty of needles in the haystack.
If you give a man a fish, he'll be hungry like the wolves, if you throw him to the wolves, then he's a fish out of water.
So close yet so cigar.
Whatever knees your bees.
If you can't handle the elephant, get out of the room.
All bark and no tree.
You can't burn your bridges and cross them too.
Give a man a fish.
There are plenty of fish in the sea.
That's just the tip of the icing on the cake.
I’m a tough cookie to crack.
